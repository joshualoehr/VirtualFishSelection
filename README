-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run, execute Application/FishEvolutionGenetic.exe


(Optional) Configure settings within code:

   Edits must be made by opening the solution file Code/FishEvolutionGenetic.sln with Visual Studio.

	1. Choose a Selection Strategy at MainWindow.xaml.cs:24 
	    Options are:
		FishSelect.TOP_3_SELECT
        	FishSelect.BOTTOM_3_SELECT
        	FishSelect.ABOVE_AVERAGE_SELECT
        	FishSelect.ROULETTE_SELECT
        	FishSelect.TOURNAMENT_SELECT
        	FishSelect.STEADY_STATE_SELECT
	2. If using Tournament Selection, configure the TOURNAMENT_SIZE hyperparameter at FishSelect.cs:231
	3. If using Steady State Selection, configure NUM_BREED (FishSelect.cs:280) and NUM_REMOVE (FishSelect.cs:281)
	4. If using Steady State Selection, toggle the use of Elitism at FishSelect.cs:282

   If changes were made, rebuild the project and use the executable at bin/Debug/FishEvolutionGenetic.exe
